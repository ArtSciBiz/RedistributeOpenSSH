# How to configure OpenSSH Client and Server on Windows 10 
# Microsoft has published OpenSSH client and server, both of which can be downloaded and installed using Microsoft's Powershell repository on GitHub. Simply go to the repository located at https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/v7.6.1.0p1-Beta For detailed instructions see the Wiki here
# I've also uploaded contents of the archive (for Windows 64bit OS), 'OpenSSH-Win64.zip', to this repository, considering the difficulty of solving the puzzle and discovering this, that involved Google Search, Microsoft Marketplace Search and looking at what's all shipped with my Windows10.
