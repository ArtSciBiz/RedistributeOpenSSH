#I've been using OpenSSH Client to connect to Linux terminals in the public cloud via the TCP port 22. This is to explain very briefly about Windows10-OpenSSH, and configuring OpenSSH Client on Windows 10. 
#Microsoft has published OpenSSH client and server, both of which can be downloaded and installed using Microsoft's Powershell repository on GitHub. There was effort to figure the right URL to the repository and hence this. Simply go to the repository located at https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/v7.6.1.0p1-Beta. For detailed instructions see the Wiki here
#I've also uploaded contents of the archive (for Windows 64bit OS), 'OpenSSH-Win64.zip', to this repository, considering the difficulty of solving the puzzle and discovering this, that involved Google Search, Microsoft Marketplace Search and looking at what's all shipped with my Windows10.
